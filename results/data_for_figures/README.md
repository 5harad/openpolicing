This folder contains the data underlying the rate scatterplots in the paper. `combined_data.csv` is a file created for convenience which combines data from all the main analyses in the paper. Each row in this file reports rates for one race group (white, Black, or Hispanic) and one location (usually county). Fields for which values cannot be computed are set to NA.
