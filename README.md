# Houston Data Visualization Data Jam

For this month's [data jam](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Visualization-Meetup/events/240580139/) we'll be exploring Texas state traffic stop data. This data was forked from the [Stanford Open Policing](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) work. They have an [R tutorial](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/tutorials/) for the dataset here.

The data is organized as follows
  
  * `/resources` contains small accessory files needed for the analysis: for example, mappings from the raw data values to standardized data values. 
  * `/tutorial` contains [placeholder].
  * `/data` contains [more data]

## Downloading the data
