For this month's [data jam](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Visualization-Meetup/events/240580139/) we'll be exploring Texas state traffic stop data. 

This repository contains the code and accessory files needed to process the state data and reproduce the analysis in the Stanford Open Policing Project. It is organized as follows: 
  
  * `/resources` contains small accessory files needed for the analysis: for example, mappings from the raw data values to standardized data values. 
  * `/tutorial` contains R tutorials for analyzing the data.
