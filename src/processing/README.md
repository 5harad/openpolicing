This folder contains all the code used to process the raw data as received from the official source into a standardized format. Since every state's data has a different format and includes different fields we have a separate script for each state. These can be found in the `/states` folder. The code that is shared between the states lives in `processing_driver.R`. The main function from this script is `process_state()`, which calls the full procedure to standardize one state's data. This folder also contains `aggregation.R`, which computes dataframes of summary statistics from the cleaned data to facilitate analysis (since some cleaned data files are very large). Finally, it contains `process_census_data.R` which puts census data into the format necessary to compute stop rate.
